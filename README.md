# Cab Booking System with Graph Data Structure and Dijkstra's Algorithm

Welcome to the Cab Booking System project! This repository contains code and documentation for a cab booking system that employs a graph data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient routing. User data is stored in a database to facilitate booking and tracking.


## Introduction
The Cab Booking System is designed to efficiently manage cab bookings, optimize routes using a graph data structure, and provide a seamless experience for both users and drivers. Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find the shortest path between locations, ensuring prompt and optimal cab allocation.

## Features
- User registration and authentication
- Booking and tracking cabs
- Optimized route calculation using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Database storage for user details and booking history

## Graph Data Structure
The project utilizes a graph data structure to represent the network of locations and routes between them. This allows for efficient computation of optimal routes for cab bookings.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path between two locations in the graph, ensuring that cab routes are optimized for time and distance.

## Database
User data, including registration details and booking history, is stored in the database. This facilitates personalized experiences and allows users to view their booking history.
